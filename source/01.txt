Learning Normals - Absolute Beginners
The Workout – In training mode pick Ryu P1 vs Ryu P1. Stun: off. Block: None. As Player 1, walk toward Player 2 by pressing forward and find the exact max range that a far standing light punch (stand jab, Square button on PS controller, X button on Xbox controller) will make contact with Player 2. Hit Player 2 with a max range stand light punch, walk away from Player 2, walk back into max range light punch, and repeat ten times. If the stand light punch whiffs, start back at one rep. Continue this method for every single far standing, crouching, and unique normal*.
The Purpose – This workout will force you to get familiar with Ryu’s normal attacks. Normal attacks are extremely important in fighting games. By finding and knowing that exact max range that a normal will make contact with your opponent is what lies at the very foundation of all fighting games. Later, this will allow you to be confident in walking into and out of the useful range of your normal attacks. Variations include: Picking a different character – This allows you to know the range of different characters normals; Setting the opponent to crouch block – You will notice that the Max range on some of your normals will be slightly increased and that other normals will whiff entirely.

*Crouching normals are performed by holding the down direction and pressing an attack button. Unique attacks are character specific attacks that require a specific directional input in addition to a button press – See Ryu’s command list for more details SFIV SFV.
