Negative Edge - All Levels
The Workout – In training mode pick Ryu vs Ryu. Turn off stun and quick rise to not waste time. Turn on Input Display so you can see exactly how your inputs are being read by the game. For this workout we will focus on a crouching medium kick cancelled into a medium kick Tatsumaki Senpukyaku (cr.mk xx mk Tatsu) by utilizing negative edge to cancel into the Tatsu. Inputs for this combo are as follows:
+(keep mk held down)>(release mk)
Technically speaking, this combo only requires one button press in order to cancel the cr.mk into Tatsu. If the Tatsu doesn’t come out then the buttons was released either too late or too early. Now perform this combo 10 times in a row. If you fail to perform this combo start back at zero. Switch sides and perform another set without failing to combo. Video Here
The Purpose – This form of canceling normals into special moves is called Negative Edge. The game engine registers the release of the button as an input giving you the ability to perform special moves with a simple release of the button. Negative Edge only applies to Special Moves and Critical Arts, you cannot throw out normals or command normals with the use of Negative Edge. You can even use Negative Edge to perform specials in the neutral, there is no need to cancel out of a normal. You may find some combos easier to perform with Negative Edge while others won’t require it at all. It will mostly be personal preference but this type of input can open up interesting option selects which will be discussed in a later workout. The variations of this workout are only limited to what you are comfortable with or think might benefit you when performing combos.
